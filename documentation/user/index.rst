==================

*Odil* (the software package) includes a command-line tool called ``odil`` which gives access to:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2
  
  print
  transcode
  dicomdir
  echo
  find
  get
  store

.. note:: If Odil was installed from source, the command-line tool requires the Python wrappers.
