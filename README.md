DCMTK++
=======

DCMTK++ is a C++11 library for the [DICOM](http://dicom.nema.org/) standard.

DCMTK++ leverages C++ constructs to provide a user-friendly API of the different
parts of the DICOM standard. Included in DCMTK++ are exception-based error
handling, generic access to datasets elements, standard JSON and XML
representation of datasets, and generic implementation of messages,
clients and servers for the various DICOM protocols.

DCMTK++ also provides conversion to and from
[DCMTK](http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en) data structures.

DCMTK++ builds and run on:
* Linux (Debian 7, Debian 8, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, both 32 and 64 bits)
* OS X
